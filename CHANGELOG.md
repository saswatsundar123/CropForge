## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Terrain Engine:** Procedural, CSV, and GeoTIFF topographies supported via the new `Terrain` class.
- **Land Preparation Modifiers:** `RidgeFurrow`, `ContourBund`, `Terrace`, `DeepTillage`, and `ConservationTillage` allow dynamic modification of the elevation grid and soil properties prior to simulation.
- **D8 Hydrology Coupling:** The deterministic-8 (D8) steepest-descent routing algorithm is now fully coupled with the new terrain system. Water routes natively over land preparation geometries (e.g. into furrows and behind bunds).
- **3D Plotly Modal:** New Terrain View toggle in the visualization dashboard seamlessly transitions from 2D heatmap to 3D procedural WebGL viewport.
- **Variable Overlays:** Users can now map agronomic variables (Nitrogen, Moisture, LAI, Stress) directly onto 3D plant models via instance coloring.

### Fixed
- **WebGL Performance Optimizations:** Eliminated geometry duplication, resolved `vertexColors` pipeline collisions, and implemented Matrix4 caching in the animation loop. 3D view now runs smoothly at 60fps.
- **Animation Anchoring:** Fixed an issue where scaling plants floated above the terrain; raycast hitboxes and instanced matrices now strictly anchor to the procedural `elevY` grid.
- **Dash Z-Index Bugs:** Corrected sidebar overlap and dropdown transparency issues introduced by the new Terrain View modal.

### Tested
- Extended unit test suite to 667 passing integration tests covering D8 terrain routing, mass conservation, and flat-grid fallbacks.

## [0.1.0] to [0.5.0]
- Core simulation loop, basic soil physics, crop phenology, dashboard rendering, and spatial integrations completed across previous PRD phases.
